# Clara's Weather App

Hello! Welcome to Clara's Weather App, my first project in React that I'm proud to present. This project showcases my journey in learning React and building a weather application with various functionalities.

## Deployed Link

You can check out the deployed version of the app [here](https://main--cute-cupcake-05e5c7.netlify.app/).

## Tools Used

- **React TypeScript**: Utilized to build the user interface and manage state in a type-safe manner.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Used for styling to create a visually appealing design.
- **OpenWeatherMaps API**: Used for fetching weather data to display current and forecast weather information.
- **Recharts API**: Integrated to generate interactive charts for weather data visualization.

## Functionalities

- **Today's Weather**: Display the current weather based on user's geolocation.
- **Detailed Weather Information**: View details such as temperature, weather conditions, humidity, wind speed, sunrise, and sunset.
- **Next Hours Forecast**: Show forecast for the next few hours.
- **5-Day Forecast**: Display forecast for the next 5 days.
- **Average Temperature and Rainfall Chart**: Visualize average temperature and rainfall for the upcoming days in a chart.

## What I Learned

Through building this project, I gained experience in working with APIs and deepened my understanding of basic React concepts. I learned how to manage state, handle asynchronous data fetching, and create reusable components.

## Next Goals

Moving forward, I plan to delve deeper into React documentation to enhance my skills further. I aim to utilize interfaces, props, and effectively divide components for better code organization and maintainability.

Thank you for visiting my Weather App!
